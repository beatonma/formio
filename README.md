# FORM/IO

This is a Kotlin Multiplatform project targeting Android, Web and Desktop.

It is a combined rewrite of three of my old Android apps:

- [FORM Clock Widget](https://beatonma.org/apps/com-beatonma-form/): Widget/Wallpaper/Screensaver port of
  the [FORM Watchface](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/form-watch-face) by [Roman Nurik](https://roman.nurik.net/)
- [#io16 Clock](https://beatonma.org/apps/org-beatonma-io16/): Widget/Wallpaper/Screensaver based on the countdown
  animation for Google I/O 2016.
- IO18 (never published): Widget/Wallpaper/Screensaver based on the countdown animation for Google I/O 2018.

You can use use the webapp [here](https://beatonma.org/apps/formio/live/), and read a little more about its
history [here](https://beatonma.org/apps/formio/).
