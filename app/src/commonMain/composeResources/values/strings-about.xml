# Formio

**This app has no affiliation with Google.**

The animated clocks found in this app are based on typefaces that were originally designed by Google. Each typeface was created for use in promotional material for specific company events.

I made this app because I found each of them delightful and thought they still deserve to be enjoyed.

# FORM

FORM was a 2014 Google conference focussing on design and technology. Its branding featured a unique typeface which was adapted into an [Android Wear watchface](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/form-watch-face) by [Roman Nurik](https://roman.nurik.net/).

Google introduced the original version of [Material Design](https://material.io) that same year. The FORM typeface compliments this with each character comprised of paper-like blocks of color tessellating and folding together.
